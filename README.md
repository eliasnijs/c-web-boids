 # Boids

 Implemenation of boids in c/c++, compiled for the web.
 
 [Here you can find the deployment of the latest release.](https://eliasnijs.xyz/projects/boids/boids.html)

\
***IMPORTANT:***\
*An overiew of the required libraries and where they can found has not been added to the project documentation yet. This will be done in the near future.*

\
**TODO:**
1. Document required libraries.
1. Implement a more robust rendering system, offloading more calculation to the gpu. This has been written in a quick and un-optimized manner at the moment.
